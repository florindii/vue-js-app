## Getting Started

-   Install Nodejs from the official [Nodejs page](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Project setup Using NPM

```
npm install
```

-   if this is not work try :

```
npm cache clean --force

```

-   or

```
npm intall  --legacy-peer-deps

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

## Vuetify

Vuetify is an Open Source UI Library that is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is handcrafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

The documentation for **Vuetify** is hosted [here](https://vuetifyjs.com/).

**_Not all components that are available in this project are part of the Template and may be a default Vuetify component_**

## Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official [devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.

## Vue-cli

We used the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` and `.postcssrc.js`.

Let us know what you think and what we can improve below. And good luck with development!

## Quick Start

-   Install Nodejs from the official [Nodejs page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   Install Yarn from the official [Yarn installation page](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).
-   Unzip the `octavia-admin.zip` file downloaded from Vuetify
-   Create a folder named `octavia-admin` and unzip the `theme.zip` file provided by the previous step
-   Open your terminal and navigate to the `octavia-admin` directory
-   Run `yarn install` to install the project's dependencies
-   Run `yarn serve` to start a local development server

You can also run additional tasks such as

-   `yarn run build` to build your app for production
-   `yarn run lint` to run linting.
